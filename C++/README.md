### Course Projects:

- [ ] [Sparse Array and Matrix]()

### Course Methodology:

- Implementations here have simple verifications or maybe even I drop the verifications.
- Data Structure is a hard topic so I keep everything simple to maximize the outcome.
- in practice we don't write something like that.

> [!NOTE]
> - I wrote all the code included here on my own after understanding the content.
